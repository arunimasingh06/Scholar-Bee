# ScholarBEE Student Wallet System

## Overview
The Student Wallet system allows students to receive, manage, and withdraw scholarship funds directly within the ScholarBEE platform. Sponsors can credit students' wallets upon scholarship approval, and students can view their balance, transaction history, and withdraw funds to their UPI accounts.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Wallet Creation:** Each student gets a wallet upon registration or first access.
- **Balance Management:** Students can view their available balance, total earned, and total withdrawn.
- **Transaction History:** All credits (scholarship awards) and debits (withdrawals) are logged.
- **UPI Integration:** Students can set/update their UPI ID for withdrawals.
- **Sponsor Integration:** When a sponsor approves a scholarship application, the corresponding amount is credited to the student's wallet.
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Students can withdraw funds to their UPI account (simulated; real UPI integration can be added).

## Backend Implementation

### 1. **Model**
- **File:** `backend/models/walletModel.js`
- **Fields:**
  - `studentId` (unique, references User)
  - `balance`, `totalEarned`, `totalWithdrawn`
  - `upiId`, `isActive`
  - `transactions[]` (type, amount, description, status, scholarshipId, applicationId, upiTransactionId, createdAt)

### 2. **Controller**
- **File:** `backend/controllers/walletController.js`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/wallet` — Get wallet info
  - `PUT /api/wallet/upi` — Update UPI ID
  - `GET /api/wallet/transactions` — Transaction history
  - `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` — Withdraw funds
  - `POST /api/wallet/credit` — Credit wallet (used by sponsor on approval)
  - `GET /api/wallet/stats` — Wallet stats

### 3. **Routes**
- **File:** `backend/routes/walletRoutes.js`
- **Mounted at:** `/api/wallet` in `backend/app.js`
- **Middleware:** All routes require authentication and student role (except `/credit`, which is used by sponsors)

### 4. **Sponsor Integration**
- When a sponsor approves an application, the backend and frontend call `/api/wallet/credit` to credit the student's wallet.

  - Allows students to update UPI ID and withdraw funds
  - Modal dialogs for UPI and withdrawal
  - Pagination and filtering for transactions

### 2. **API Service**
- **File:** `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- **Exported as:** `walletAPI`
- **Methods:**
  - `getWallet()`, `updateUpiId(upiId)`, `getTransactions(page, limit, type)`, `withdrawFunds(amount)`, `getStats()`, `creditWallet(applicationId, amount, description)`

### 3. **Navigation**
- **Wallet link** added to the student navbar and dashboard for easy access.

### 4. **Sponsor Flow**
- When a sponsor approves an application, the wallet is credited automatically via the `/api/wallet/credit` endpoint.
