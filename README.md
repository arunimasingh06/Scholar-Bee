> **A full-stack Micro-scholarship management platform connecting students with educational opportunities and sponsors**

## 🎯 What We Built

A Micro-scholarship is a small financial award typically given to students for specific achievements, milestones, or behaviors, rather than a large, lump-sum traditional scholarship. These can help students gradually earn money for college or other educational needs.
ScholarBEE is a comprehensive Micro-scholarship management system that bridges the gap between students seeking financial aid and organizations offering scholarships.

### Key Features of Micro-Scholarships

- **💰 Small Amounts**: Awards usually range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars.

- **🧠 Merit-Based or Activity-Based**: Given for things like good grades, extracurricular involvement, community service, test scores, etc.

- **🏫 Cumulative**: Students can earn multiple micro-scholarships over time, which add up.

- **🎯 Often Targeted at High School Students**: Especially those preparing for college.

( **NOTE**: "We are in an active phase of research and development, working to introduce innovative features that will enrich user experience and strengthen the impact of micro-scholarships." )
